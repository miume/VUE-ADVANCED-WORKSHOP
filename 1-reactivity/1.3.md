# 1.3 Mini Observer

## Goal

- `observer()` converts the properties in the received object and make them reactive.For each converted property, it gets assigned a `Dep` instance which keeps trace of a list of subscribing update functions, and triggers them to re-run when its setter is invoked
  - 响应式监控对象的每个属性，每个属性对应一个Dep实例，与属性订阅者保持联系
- `autorun` takes an update function and re-runs it when properties that the update function subscribes to have been mutated. An update function is said to be "subscribing" to a property if it relies on that property during its evaluation.
  - 当更新功能订阅的属性已被更改时，autorun将使用更新功能并重新运行它



```js
const state = {
  count: 0
}

observe(state); //collecting dependencies

autorun(() => {
  console.log('count change:',state.count)
})

state.count++  // should log 'count change 1'
```
